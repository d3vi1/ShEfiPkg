This is a horrible hack.

Just before elilo calls into the kernel it calls vga_init
and passes a pointer to the kernels parameter table.

vga_init does the following:

1) search through the RAM (from the compressed EFI firmware rom)
   for the intel VGA bios.
2) setup a real mode x86 emulator and copy the rom into 0xc0000 in 
   the emulator, trap all the interrupt vectors in the emulator
   to stop the VGA bios trying to call the system bios.
3) execute the VGA bios rom. The VGA bios rom reads the EDID information
   from the monitor and modifies! itself.
4) tell the ICH7 chipset to map RW memory at 0xc0000, and to point 
   0xa0000 to the video card.
5) copy the interrupt vectors (specifically int 0x10), the BIOS parameter 
   table, and the ROM from the emulator into real memory.
6) in the emulator execute code equivalent to the linux kernel's video.S
   and set the boot parameters accordingly
7) transfer control back to the kernel.

Thanks to Matthew Garrett, whose work with vbetool this 
builds on.

To get this to work, you need to apply the patches in the patches directory.
The first to elilo which links this code in, and the second to the kernel
which tells it to use the legacy VGA mode even in the presence of EFI.
